If however you set delay to `0`, `asap` will wait for current synchronously executing\r\n * code to end and then it will try to execute given task as fast as possible.\r\n *\r\n * `asap` scheduler will do its best to minimize time between end of currently executing code\r\n * and start of scheduled task. This makes it best candidate for performing so called \"deferring\".\r\n * Traditionally this was achieved by calling `setTimeout(deferredTask, 0)`, but that technique involves\r\n * some (although minimal) unwanted delay.\r\n *\r\n * Note that using `asap` scheduler does not necessarily mean that your task will be first to process\r\n * after currently executing code. In particular, if some task was also scheduled with `asap` before,\r\n * that task will execute first. That being said, if you need to schedule task asynchronously, but\r\n * as soon as possible, `asap` scheduler is your best bet.\r\n *\r\n * @example <caption>Compare async and asap scheduler</caption>\r\n *\r\n * Rx.Scheduler.async.schedule(() => console.log('async')); // scheduling 'async' first...\r\n * Rx.Scheduler.asap.schedule(() => console.log('asap'));\r\n *\r\n * // Logs:\r\n * // \"asap\"\r\n * // \"async\"\r\n * // ... but 'asap' goes first!\r\n *\r\n * @static true\r\n * @name asap\r\n * @owner Scheduler\r\n */\r\nexport var asap = /*@__PURE__*/ new AsapScheduler(AsapAction);\r\n//# sourceMappingURL=asap.js.map \r\n",null]}
