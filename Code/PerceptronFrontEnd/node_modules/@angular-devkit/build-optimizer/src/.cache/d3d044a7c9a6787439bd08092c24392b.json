It might be useful, if you do not have control over\r\n * internal scheduler of a given Observable, but want to control when its values are emitted nevertheless.\r\n *\r\n * Returned Observable emits the same notifications (nexted values, complete and error events) as the source Observable,\r\n * but rescheduled with provided scheduler. Note that this doesn't mean that source Observables internal\r\n * scheduler will be replaced in any way. Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits\r\n * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.\r\n * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split\r\n * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source\r\n * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a\r\n * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.\r\n *\r\n * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications\r\n * will be emitted. The main difference between {@link delay} operator and `observeOn` is that `observeOn`\r\n * will delay all notifications - including error notifications - while `delay` will pass through error\r\n * from source Observable immediately when it is emitted. In general it is highly recommended to use `delay` operator\r\n * for any kind of delaying of values in the stream, while using `observeOn` to specify which scheduler should be used\r\n * for notification emissions in general.\r\n *\r\n * @example <caption>Ensure values in subscribe are called just before browser repaint.</caption>\r\n * const intervals = Rx.Observable.interval(10); // Intervals are scheduled\r\n *                                               // with async scheduler by default...\r\n *\r\n * intervals\r\n * .observeOn(Rx.Scheduler.animationFrame)       // ...but we will observe on animationFrame\r\n * .subscribe(val => {                           // scheduler to ensure smooth animation.\r\n *   someDiv.style.height = val + 'px';\r\n * });\r\n *\r\n * @see {@link delay}\r\n *\r\n * @param {IScheduler} scheduler Scheduler that will be used to reschedule notifications from source Observable.\r\n * @param {number} [delay] Number of milliseconds that states with what delay every notification should be rescheduled.\r\n * @return {Observable<T>} Observable that emits the same notifications as the source Observable,\r\n * but with provided scheduler.\r\n *\r\n * @method observeOn\r\n * @owner Observable\r\n */\r\nexport function observeOn(scheduler, delay) {\r\n    if (delay === void 0) {\r\n        delay = 0;\r\n    }\r\n    return higherOrder(scheduler, delay)(this);\r\n}\r\n//# sourceMappingURL=observeOn.js.map \r\n",null]}
