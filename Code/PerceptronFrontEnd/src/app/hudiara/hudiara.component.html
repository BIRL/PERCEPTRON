    <p>Recent studies have reported alarming levels of Copper (Cu), Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Cadmium (Cd), Chromium (Cr), Arsenic (As) and Nickel (Ni) in the ground water from areas adjoining Hadiara drain. These heavy metal concentrations are far above the World Health Organization (WHO) limits. To further aggravate the situation, Science Advances has recently reported the highest ever (50µg/L) arsenic poisoning of underground water table in Punjab and Sindh, according to which approximately a quarter of Pakistani population stands affected. To aggravate the situation further, underground seepage of Hadiara waste water is adding high levels of lead and bacterial contamination into groundwater. In this project, we are undertaking a comprehensive meta-proteome profiling of microbial life in untreated waste water of Hudiara drain. We are measuring and benchmarking the microbiota’s recycling performance of Hadiara’s toxic contaminants, by analyzing microbial proteome. Microbiota take the focus of this project as they play a key role in in reclamation of waste water by removing heavy metals.</p>
